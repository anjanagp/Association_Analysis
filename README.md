# Association_Analysis

Implemented Apriori algorithm to identify all frequent itemsets that satisfy the support threshold.
Generated association rules based on a given template to correlate gene expressions to diseases, based on the query specified and
the confidence threshold.

Apriori algorithm is an algorithm that is applied to transactional databases.It is used to mine frequent itemsets from the 
given data.
The generated itemsets are then used to determine association rules which highlight the general trends that are present in the
database. 
It is used in domains such as e-commerce, marketbasketanalysis and so on.
